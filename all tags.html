     <span>Every dog has its <b>unique temperament and comfort level when meeting new canine companions</b>. For example, while some are naturally outgoing, others might be more reserved or hesitant around unfamiliar faces. Understanding your dog's demeanor is crucial to facilitate safe and comfortable introductions.

        It's essential to be observant and watch for signs of anxiety or aggression. While they might not vocalize their discomfort directly, there are clear indicators. Look out for behaviors like growling, snarling, raised hackles, or a rigid body posture. Recognizing these cues early can help prevent any unwanted incidents and ensure a smoother introduction process.</span>
